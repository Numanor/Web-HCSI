            My research focuses on social affective computing. In particular, I am interested in emotion quantization, modeling methods and interactive applications. Facing the large-scale social media data, my research motivations come from the following issues and challenges: 1) the traditional approach to measuring emotions based on simple categories has encountered limitations, which is not enough to accurately profile users’ complex emotions and describe the diversity among users; 2) social media data are large-scale, heterogeneous and temporal, which brings challenges to integrate the text, image, speech, as well as users’ demographics and social attributes (e.g. users’ gender, age, occupation, friend relationship, group relationship, etc.) into the modeling process in a temporal mode; and 3) applying affective computing methods for analyzing and predicting users’ mental health is a valuable research topic, which could contribute to prevent dangerous incidents and encourage users by positive and scientific way to promote their life quality.<br><br>
            To resolve the challenges above, I proposed solutions in three aspects. Firstly, construct dimensional emotion description approach based on mental model; Secondly, model heterogeneous multi-modality data with social attributes for emotion understanding; Last but not least, implement affective interactive applications for mental health care. The three aspects are closely correlated and benefit each other. Constructing dimensional emotion description approach based on mental model are the theoretical basis of modeling and applications; Modeling heterogeneous multi-modality data with social attributes is the key research for social affective computing and the important guarantee for good performance in applications; Designing affective interactive applications for mental health care are not only the final target of affective modeling, but also the important way for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed modeling methods. All these efforts target a deeper understanding of users’ emotions, which I believe to be one of the most important factors yet to be integrated in the next generation of human computer interaction and artificial intelligence.
